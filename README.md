# Linked List Implementation in C

## Overview

This C library provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list data structure. It includes functions for appending nodes, inserting nodes at specified positions, searching for a value, merging two lists, printing the elements, and freeing the memory allocated for the list.

## Functions

1. **append(Node **head_ref, int val)**
   - Appends a new node with the given value to the end of the linked list.

2. **Insert(Node* prev_node, int val)**
   - Inserts a new node with the given value after the specified node in the linked list.

3. **free_list(Node** head_ref)**
   - Frees the memory allocated for all nodes in the linked list.

4. **printNode(Node* node)**
   - Prints the value of a given node.

5. **Search(Node* head, int val)**
   - Searches for a node with the specified value in the linked list.

6. **Insert_I(Node** head_ref, int position, int val)**
   - Inserts a new node with the given value at the specified position in the linked list.

7. **Merge(Node* list1, Node* list2)**
   - Merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
